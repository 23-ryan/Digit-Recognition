# Digit Recognition

## *Brief Introcuction*
This project is completely based on training a neural network to predict **handwritten digits**, without using any external libraries except for **numpy**  and **matplotlib**. <br>
I implemented a neural network with a **single hidden layer** and trained that using batch gradient descent thorugh **forward-backward** propagation algorithms.
